{"id":464,"title":"","text":"In fact, I've taken it several times to Costco and was able to push\/pull the stroller alongside a loaded cart.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}

{"id":464,"title":"","text":"I have no problem pushing it loaded with all three kids.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"It does take up the entire back of our minivan, but I will trade the loss of storage for the ability to actually push all three kids at once.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"Based on our experience with this stroller, I would recommend the Joovy line to anyone.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}

{"id":464,"title":"","text":"The quality is excellent,I receive compliments everywhere I go and the kids love it.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"The only downsides are the seat on the back for the older child doesn't lock into place so they kind of just slide back and forth until they whine enough to get out.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"Also,I recommend purchasing the black.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"The lime looks awesome at first, but once it gets dirty it is horrible and I have never figured out how to remove the seat covers to wash (if at all possible.)","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}

{"id":464,"title":"","text":"Everyone wants to know where I purchased it.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"It is a little heavy, but you have to remember that you can move three children on this thing at once, so it needs to be heavy to be sturdy.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"I have tried other double sit-n-stand strollers, and they feel so flimsy compared to the Joovey Big Caboose.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"It has plenty of room under the seats to store stuff, you just have to manuver larger items around the back seat's foot rest.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"I would recommend the key-coffee cup neoprene holder that attaches to the handle.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}

{"id":464,"title":"","text":"I have a Honda Pilot and it just fits in the trunk behind the back seat.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"The best part is that I can fit on even smaller elevators in the malls and I don't have to look for a service elevator like I would with the side-by-side strollers.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"Would definitely recommend to friends with small children.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}

{"id":464,"title":"","text":"But;(1)not a great deal of room for my two year old with the infant seats on.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"(2)I have to put my whole body into turns, it also feels like it could tip with two car seats and a two-year old (3)The \"jump seat\" for the two-year old doesn't stay in place, it scoots back, which causes him to lean forward and eventualy I have to stop, and pull the seat back up.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"It needs a locking mechanism.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"(4)it absolutely will not fit into a bathroom stall at the mall, so take a friend and take turns watching the kids.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"I think that without the infant car seats, the whole thing would work better.  ","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}

{"id":464,"title":"","text":"It is a triple stroller, so expect it to be BIG.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"However, it handles really well.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"It is much easier to maneuver than my duoglider double stroller.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"It it easier when the lightest child rides in the front seat.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"My only complaint is that it doesn't fit in my mid size suv without putting a third row seat down so use the measurements provided if this is a concern.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"Overall, its a great product, good quality, and a nice look.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}

{"id":464,"title":"","text":"I have had to struggle to stop it from falling sideways many times.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"The backseat will not stay in the upright position so when my 2 year old is in the jump seat, the back seat keeps reclining and pushing on her head.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"Also the jump seat doesn't stay in position and my daughter finds it very uncomfortable when it sinks under the rear seat.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}

{"id":464,"title":"","text":"I called Joovy to speak to someone about all the problems we had.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}
{"id":464,"title":"","text":"Pam the customer service rep was very rude and unhelpful.","asin":"B000NDY7TY"}

{"id":16922,"title":"","text":"It colors just as well as the demi permanents but gives a more vibrant-natural tone to the hair without damaging with chemicals.  ","asin":"B001ET7LAI"}

{"id":16922,"title":"","text":"I have used it twice since I purchased it a few months ago.","asin":"B001ET7LAI"}
{"id":16922,"title":"","text":"The first time, the color wasn't as noticeable because I made a few mistakes and left it in for too little time (also, I used ginger instead of paprika).","asin":"B001ET7LAI"}
{"id":16922,"title":"","text":"The second time (a month after the first), I mixed it with yogurt, paprika, and lemon juice, and left it in my hair with an intermittent heat source for about 6 hours.","asin":"B001ET7LAI"}

{"id":16922,"title":"","text":"I'm a little disappointed because I think I chose the wrong shade for my skin tone.","asin":"B001ET7LAI"}
{"id":16922,"title":"","text":"It took about 15 minutes to apply the product, and I left it on for 15 minutes (as indicated by the strand test), so the total time was about 30 minutes.","asin":"B001ET7LAI"}
{"id":16922,"title":"","text":"It turned out a bit too orange for my taste.","asin":"B001ET7LAI"}
{"id":16922,"title":"","text":"It could be because my hair is very fine and was probably porous from the chemical dyes (and my hair tends to take VERY strongly to red), but I was wary about leaving it on longer for fear it would turn an even brighter shade of orange.","asin":"B001ET7LAI"}
{"id":16922,"title":"","text":"I think if I had gone with a reddish-brown shade, like the Auburn or the Mahogany, I might be happier with the color.","asin":"B001ET7LAI"}

{"id":16922,"title":"","text":"I think I will definitely use this product again, just a different shade that's better for my skin tone (pale, pinkish undertones).UPDATE:24 hours later, and the color has oxidized to a deeper reddish-orange tone.","asin":"B001ET7LAI"}
{"id":16922,"title":"","text":"This tone is much more complimentary with my skin.","asin":"B001ET7LAI"}
{"id":16922,"title":"","text":"I was reading about henna online, and one resource said not to \"freak out\" over the initial orange color because it will \"settle\" and oxidize into a deeper tone over the next two-three days.","asin":"B001ET7LAI"}

{"id":83,"title":"","text":"And though it has wood floors, it has scuffed up my phone on the corners.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"This case, being crystal clear, doesn't detract at all from the look of the phone and provides protection from the brutal outhouse floors.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"And it is easy to clean when it lands in a wet spot on the outhouse floor.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}

{"id":83,"title":"","text":"It fits it like a glove, and leaves all the ports (head phones, charger) easy to get to.  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Also, even though it covers the buttons, I find it makes the volume and power buttons even easier to push than without a cover.  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"They are very flat on the phone, and these raised cover buttons make them easier to use.  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"The cutout for the camera makes it so the lens is protected when you place it down on a table, and the front side is raised enough that the screen is protected if you place it face down.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"All in all, this is a perfect case for those that like the slim-form-factor type of case.  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"No, I don't think it would protect too much if I dropped it from high up.  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"But I didn't get it for that, I just wanted something slim and clear (to show off this great phone) that would keep it free from scratches and give it just a little bit of protection.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"If you have the same view of cases as I do (slim, clear, keep scratches away and give a little protection) than get this case!!!  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"If you want the total protection, can survive a high drop and water....look at those other very bulky cases out there.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Oh ya, one other great plus to this case is it is very 'grippy',","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"the naked phone, while it feels sexy as hell, is very slick and I could so see it slipping out of my hand and falling.  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}

{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Unfortunately, the back of the case is very unattractive.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"With the black HTC one the clear case does not show through and just looks like a very dirty clear color that is very ugly.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}

{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Perfect fit.  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Durable and stylish.  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}

{"id":83,"title":"","text":"No problem or scratch.  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"I would definitely recommend this product to another user.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"This TPU case works exactly like I expected it would.  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"It fits snug, and protects the rear camera lens and the front screen, and makes it a little easier to grip the phone securely.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"I was a little surprised that the power button was covered by the case, given that the button also serves as an IR blaster for the One's TV remote control functions, but the thin layer of TPU doesn't seem to affect my ability to control my AV gear with the phone.

{"id":83,"title":"","text":"I guess I can always take a razor blade to that part of the case if it becomes a problem, but I don't think it will come to that.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"I was also a little surprised that this &#34;black&#34; case was actually kind of a &#34;smoked&#34; color, with my silver phone showing through pretty well.  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"I like the look, though, it gives the phone a kind of metallic gray color and allows the HTC logo on the back to show through.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Overall, I really like the case and would not hesitate to recommend it.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"This case material collects fingerprint smudges so much that it arrived already dirty-looking.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"This color is not transparent due to all the grime it collects!","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Let's be honest, for a few dollars more there are better cases out there but at $6 the i-Blason is good protection from normal every day use.  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"It's a bit heavier than I expected considering its low profile design but still MUCH lighter than my Incipio DualPro case.  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"If you want a backup or just need some sort of minimal protection for your phone you can't beat this case for the price.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"I was so excited to get this case.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Mostly because I wanted protection for this beautifully crafted phone.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Once I got the case I put it on with great ease and the fit was super snug.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"No loose ends whatsoever.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"The grip this provides is perfect, cause you know the HTC one is all aluminum, so it is quite slippery.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"And the last and most impressive quality of the case is it's transparency.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"It is see through, kind of.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"It is a smokey color, but I love that I have great protection and the quality of the phone is not hidden!","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"I am very pleased with my purchase and I believe you will be if you buy it!!!","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Perfect fit for an HTC One with some added bonuses - those bonuses being the raised buttons for volume and unlock.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Unlike it's predecessor, the HTC EVO 4G LTE that had buttons so raised up they were always being hit accidentally, and were light to the touch, the HTC One's buttons are much harder to hit accidentally.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"They are so hard to hit, by the way, that it's almost impossible to adjust the volume without using two hands - one to hold the hold, the other to actually push the buttons.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"This case raises the buttons up so they are MUCH easier to use without making them TOO easy to hit accidentally.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"A protective case that makes the phone actually easier to use with one hand.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Win-Win situation!","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"My fianc&eacute; is using this cover and he loves it.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"I think his favorite part is that it is clear.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Frost clear really is what it means, the back has this frosted look to it, meaning that unless you have a white or silver HTC ONE, any other color is not going to look as great in it.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"I was a bit disappointed that the whole case wasn't entirely clear like the sides but that is just a small complaint.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"This case is primarily to showcase your phone as well as protect the aluminum sides\/finish of your phone from nicks and scratches.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"I've had the case for about a month now and it protects the phone quite fine.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"A bonus is that there is a small rise\/lip above the screen, meaning you can place your phone screen down and not have to worry about damaging your screen at all.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"The case is truly flexible, so you don't have to worry about any shattering or snapping of the case.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"It's fairly easy to apply onto the phone and it fits quite snugly onto it as well.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"The power and volume buttons are raised, they make the phone a bit more responsive actually and you don't have to use as much force as normally would have to.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"The case has yet to yellow, I've heard reviews about TPU material cases turning yellow, but then again I mainly pull my phone out indoors.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Letting the case be exposed to sunlight for a long time will cause things like this to yellow.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"I've uploaded some photos for the product to give you a better idea of the case itself.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Good luck on making your decision.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"I was one of those that looked at a variety of other different products, and really did my homework; in the end I took a chance on this one and it's worked out fine for me.  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}

{"id":83,"title":"","text":"I loved it when it first arrived.  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"6 months later the crystal clear case is a grungy yellow...","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"This case covers the corners and makes it easier to press the power button on the phone.  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"The cutouts are all properly placed.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Great fit and the cutouts are perfect!","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Volume nubs work great as well they're easy to push, a problem with other competitors.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Will buy again!Update: Still a very well molded good quality case, but like all TPU cases it starts to yellow after about 2 months.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"I thought about trying to get a replacement one with their 1 year warranty, but figured I would just buy a couple more, at $5.99 not a big cost to protect my awesome $600 Silver HTC ONE M7.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"The clear\/frost case really lets the silver show.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"I get compliments on the phone all the time, you really don't notice the case when it's this clear one.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"For the price this is a nice case although I don't think is will save the phone if dropped, but will keep the scratches off the back plate and since it is see thru the metal back shows thru , fits the phone nicely and easy to put on but just FYI the back speakers on the right side bottom do not have and cut out space so this would render them useless","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Bought this case for my wife's phone.  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}

{"id":83,"title":"","text":"I was excited when I received the i-Blason case with all the positive reviews, I like the fit, it does not move, it fits like a glove.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"The only thing that I do not like is how the pictures show that the power button is open and the case that I got has the power button\/IR blaster covered.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"I tried it and it does not work with the case I am very disappointed in that aspect.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"The volume rockers covers are solid I never like my volume buttons to be covered but this case does a real good job with the volume cover feedback.  ","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"But overall the case is great and I highly recommend it.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"I think that I can get a Xacto blade and cut out the power button cover.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}

{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Sure...I'll go along with that, but there were other problems.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"The cutout for the HTC On Max IR blaster for changing tv channels isn't actually...cut out.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"It's like the makers of this case THOUGHT it was for a power button and only made an indentation for this mythical button.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Next, the volume rocker\/power buttons on the side of the case hardly do anything when pressing them.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"You have to press so damned hard, your fingers will hurt JUST pressing them.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}
{"id":83,"title":"","text":"Upon further inspection on the inside of the case's button locations, there is nothing there.","asin":"B00BL5CSN0"}

{"id":12673,"title":"","text":"The other sheet gives a range.","asin":"B0002E2TVM"}
{"id":12673,"title":"","text":"Since each part of the head stretches the whole head to some degree, what I did was tighten them all to finger-tight, then gave each one about a half revolution until they felt equal with a drum key.","asin":"B0002E2TVM"}
{"id":12673,"title":"","text":"Then, I found the tightest one with the dial and set them to that.","asin":"B0002E2TVM"}
{"id":12673,"title":"","text":"Usually this was at or just above the recommended setting.","asin":"B0002E2TVM"}

{"id":12673,"title":"","text":"I did my old method halfway, then their method to finish, and it worked.","asin":"B0002E2TVM"}
{"id":12673,"title":"","text":"Also, to clarify how it works (because the description and pictures don't really do it adequately):It's basically a modified analog point pressure sensor.  ","asin":"B0002E2TVM"}
{"id":12673,"title":"","text":"It weighs a couple pounds, and is a heavy disk with a guage on top, but in the bottom center of the disk it has a metal point that moves up and down.  ","asin":"B0002E2TVM"}

{"id":12673,"title":"","text":"It's very sensitive - a tiny turn on the drum key and it will register.  ","asin":"B0002E2TVM"}
{"id":12673,"title":"","text":"It took a little getting used to, but once I did (and figured out what I described above) it worked great.  ","asin":"B0002E2TVM"}
{"id":12673,"title":"","text":"Also, since each lug slightly affects the pull on all the others, I went around and aimed to bring each lug up to 1 mark below my goal, and then I didn't overshoot and that made things much easier.","asin":"B0002E2TVM"}
{"id":12673,"title":"","text":"Bottom line:  Great product, incomplete directions.","asin":"B0002E2TVM"}

{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"The Bad:- The preamp quality is not that great.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"I want to be careful not to over-state this too much: they are certainly not BAD preamps, and they are certainly competitive with other preamps that can be bought eight at a whack for $300, but they are not fast-response, high-headroom, ultra-clean studio preamps.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"They are more like the preamps on a decent portastudio (duh).","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"They have a bit of a tendency to flab out on DI bass tracks, and can turn a bit crunchy\/hashy at the top with difficult program material such as cymbals or detailed condensers.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"Backing off the input gain and recording at lower levels helps but does not completely solve these issues.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"And ribbon mics are pretty much right out: there's just not enough clean gain to drive low-output mics while preserving sound quality.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"But they are perfectly adequate for midrangey, high-output dynamic live mics, such as Shure SM57s and 58s, and considering the price point and what you're buying, they are actually quite capable: VASTLY better than the 1\/8\" mic\/line input on a typical consumer soundcard, and comparable with a typical budget\/prosumer mixer or live console.- Phantom power on only two channels.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"I imagine this is a limitation of using USB\/battery power, and it's frankly kind of amazing that they can deliver 48V at all.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"But it is still a limitation.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"If you want to use this box for full-blown studio recording, for this reason and the above, you'll probably want to have some outboard preamps or a mixing console or some such (soundcraft makes some inexpensive mixers with pretty good preamps).- Zero midi anything.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"I'm not sure if this is a \"bad\", so much as just something to be aware of.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"Inclusion of a simple GM synth or drum machine, or even the ability to record MIDI would have expanded the usefulness of this box, but also would have added a lot of complexity to the little menu-based LCD interface.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"Overall I think it was a better decision to leave it out, and keep the device easier to use, but it's worth being aware of: if you want to record midi instruments with this box, you will be recording the output as audio.- Usability\/latency problems as a computer audio interface.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"I found this box to be unsatisfying as a laptop audio interface using early 2010 drivers.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"USB audio interfaces can be iffy compared with firewire or PCI, and this was no exception.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}

{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"Such problems were intermittent, but even occasional meltdowns can make such a device almost unusable.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"It's easier to simply record standalone to the Zoom R16 and then dump the files into computer via USB for editing and mixing in your favorite DAW software.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"Bear in mind that every computer is a bit different, so YMMV, and future firmware or driver updates may help the situation.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"But for now I cannot recommend it as a primary multitrack audio interface for computer-based recording (although I certainly recommend it as a portable multitrack recorder that can integrate with a computer setup).So much for the bad.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}

{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"If you are new to recording, it may not be clear what a revolutionary thing this is, to have a complete, legitimate recording studio that you can leave on the coffee table or stick in a backpack and take a full project from recording, through mixing, with effects, and run the whole thing on six AA batteries.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"Battery-powered recorders are obviously not new, but this box is genuinely a fully-capable recording studio that achieves the magic number of 8 simultaneous inputs, with effects and mixing.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}

{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"The more tracks and more processing and effects you're using, the faster they deplete, but even at full load you're changing batteries maybe every two hours, more than enough time to re-charge a spare set of rechargeables.- SD storage.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"Using SD cards as the storage medium means cheap and easy storage, but even better, no fans, no motors, no whirring\/clicking hard disk... this box is *silent*.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"It also means that it records like tape: there is no saving, no file-management... just hit record or play, turn power on and off whenever you want-- no worries, and no inspiration-killing hassle.- Ease of use is really good.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}

{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"The R16's true 8-input recording and 16-track playback allow it to skip\/simplify internal routing, bussing, etc, making it very straightforward to use: every physical channel is a track, and there is a bank up\/down key to determine whether you're working with tracks 1-8, or 9-16.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}

{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"Digging into the menus further allows you to assign any effect to any track, to change whether insert effects are \"hard-coded\" onto the incoming audio, or just applied as a bus effect (for example, if you wanted to hear the effect during tracking and playback, but keep the underlying audio \"clean\" for later processing in a computer DAW or whatever).","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}

{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"Some of the settings are a little weird, and I'd much rather do a full mixdown using hardware processors or computer plugins than using menu-based text inputs, but the effects are all real-time, and you can hear your changes as you make them, so it's certainly possible to do a full record with this box alone, and effects quality is comparable to other digital hardware processors.- Overall sound quality is quite good.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}
{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"Even factoring in the preamp reservations above, 15 years ago you could have spent 10 or 15 thousand dollars EASILY and still not had the sound quality and capability of this little box (plus you would have needed 20 electrical outlets and a room to store it all in, not to mention hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of racks and cables).","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}

{"id":17938,"title":"","text":"Laptop-based mobile DAWs have always seemed like an awesome idea, but in practice things like boot times, dongles, limited mobile interface options, mixing and control via mousepad, short battery life, self-noise, computer-related reliability and stability issues, etc have always tended to keep it a good \"idea\" as opposed to a truly mobile \"on your lap\" studio.","asin":"B002I7TJNW"}

{"id":21336,"title":"","text":"If the snow is slightly thick, these screws often give way under the pressure, and need to be tightened back in.","asin":"B008FV5R2C"}
{"id":21336,"title":"","text":"Annoying because you have to stop the machine, remove your gloves, walk to the front (likely in snow), and then tighten the screws back.","asin":"B008FV5R2C"}

{"id":1693,"title":"","text":"Cons:","asin":"B004WMITDW"}
{"id":1693,"title":"","text":"This case is huge!  ","asin":"B004WMITDW"}
{"id":1693,"title":"","text":"It seems like Plano tried to create a &#34;case for all bows&#34; and in order to do that, they had to make it a complete monstrosity.  ","asin":"B004WMITDW"}
{"id":1693,"title":"","text":"While it may fit every crossbow imaginable and accommodates reverse-limb bows, the thing weighs 3 times the weight of my bow and when it's open it takes up my almost entire living room floor and was not made specifically for the reverse limb system.","asin":"B004WMITDW"}
{"id":1693,"title":"","text":"One of the perks of reverse limb crossbows is the narrowness of the limbs.  ","asin":"B004WMITDW"}
{"id":1693,"title":"","text":"Since the Plano Manta (this model) isn't specifically designed for that system, it has these large &#34;wings&#34; that span over a foot of extra space on the sides (7.5&#34; on each side).  ","asin":"B004WMITDW"}

{"id":1693,"title":"","text":"Perhaps you can put accessories in there, or maybe a pillow.  ","asin":"B004WMITDW"}
{"id":1693,"title":"","text":"But, it makes this case incredibly cumbersome and unwieldy.  ","asin":"B004WMITDW"}

{"id":2998,"title":"","text":"I did do it after some help","asin":"B001LQJY7M"}
{"id":2998,"title":"","text":"but they put more pressure on my knuckles and began cutting off the circulation on my fingers because of how tight everything is.","asin":"B001LQJY7M"}

{"id":2998,"title":"","text":"Before getting into this review, some background information is relevant:-I've been doing endurance heavy bag workouts for about 4 months now after deciding to try to get back into the fighting shape of my youth, and I've tried a number of different wraps and light gloves while doing so.-I usually hit the bag for an hour to ninety minutes, 4 to 5 days a week, and I needed something that was heavy enough to prevent severe knuckle damage while light enough to still allow scarring and calcification of the knuckles, as I don't see much point in building arm definition if you split your knuckles on the first punch in a real scrape.-I started out with old muay thai 108\" wraps, but found they were FAR too light, and tore knuckles within the first week of bag work.  ","asin":"B001LQJY7M"}
{"id":2998,"title":"","text":"Torn knuckles equal downtime and feeling weak, neither of which are conducive to workout commitment.-Next, I tried Evergel wraps.  ","asin":"B001LQJY7M"}
{"id":2998,"title":"","text":"These things gave good knuckle protection at first, but they were shoddily made and they tore at the stitching within a week, with one set literally tearing the same day I bought them.  ","asin":"B001LQJY7M"}
{"id":2998,"title":"","text":"I can't afford to replace 25 dollar gloves once a week, so those were quickly out.-After that, I tried Everlast Mexican 180\" Wraps.  ","asin":"B001LQJY7M"}

{"id":2998,"title":"","text":"They also are a hassle to put on\/take off\/clean\/adjust during a session, although I think a lot of that is just finding a style of wrapping your hands that works well for you, and also that my time on the bag fell into a limited time-frame where I didn't want to waste ten minutes wrapping my hands.-The final attempt before switching to Title Platinums was to add Evergel inserts to my existing Mexican wraps.  ","asin":"B001LQJY7M"}
{"id":2998,"title":"","text":"I DO NOT recommend these; they don't stick to the knuckles as advertised, and this results in shifting during workouts and having to adjust your wraps to better hold them in place.  ","asin":"B001LQJY7M"}

{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"Anyway, here are some of the things I noticed on first inspection...","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"Cards and colors -- The cards came in great condition with a variety of colors, sets, creatures, and spells.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"My order primarily came with black and colorless cards.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"All the cards came as stated in the description (with a couple extras thrown in).Rares and card value -- The rares and mythics were not anything to get excited about, but all are fair and useful.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"The rest are semi-useful, great for editing decks and expanding a collection.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"Only about a 4th of the cards can be called &#34;old&#34; (2002 down).Foreign cards -- Only 2 in my order.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"To my dismay, one was a rare.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"Never-the-less, I am pleased it only came with 2.Lands and counters -- Only 2 counters and 4 basic lands.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"However, a fair amount of &#34;other&#34; land cards was included.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"Mixed cards -- About 60 mixed cards in this lot, some of them &#34;guild&#34; cards.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"Duplicates -- Most of the commons and uncommons were duplicated.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"They averaged around 3-4 copies for 1 in 3 cards.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"The highest count was 10 for a single card.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"None of the rares or mythics were duplicated.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"Recommendations --","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"This is an awesome deal to split with friends or if your looking to boost your collection.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"Also great if you need an &#34;instant&#34; collection, would be a good starter if it came with basic lands.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"Formal players may not see much value in this lot, but if your a casual player or collector, this lot is probably made for you!","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"It also works well for gifts, I made grab decks out of mine for friends.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"The &#34;Scoop&#34; -- I give this 5 stars because it's simply an awesome deal.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}

{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"I also want to note with respect the excelent service and condition in which this package arrived.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"After reading through the reviews I was expecting there to be a fair amount of duplicates, but the number of duplicates in my set was beyond anything I read.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"While sorting through the cards I noticed there were cards repeated frequently so I started to set them aside.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"After my first pass through the cards I pulled out 52 Screeching Skaab, 50 Secrets of the Dead, and 38 Faithless Looting.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"After a second pass I found a bunch of other cards that had 15+ duplicates.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"My order was filled by CCG Unlimited and after this I will never order anything from them.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"I can't say if the other sellers are any better, but based on my experiences and those of some other reviewers I would avoid this set.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"I mean lots, seems to fill in the blanks they put tons of useless cards(sometimes as many as ten) of a pretty weak card and when you have lots of cards that are not good eight to ten times it starts to add up.  ","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"So for the price it's worth it but just have to sort through all the junk.  ","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"Also don't expect any mythic rares\/rares that will be very useful, somehow they found all the cards I don't really want and bundled them together, think out of the thousand(didn't count but there was a lot","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"so I'll take their word for it)","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"I added maybe three cards to my decks.  ","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}

{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"Just pointing it out.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"The TLG Games lot had 5 mythic rares, which was nice.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"Untapped Games only had rares, not mythics(if I remember correctly).","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"The problem with the lot from TLG Games is that every good point came with a caveat: 5 mythic rares were nice, but there were two duplicates out of the five.(of course this would be fine if it was some epic card, but it was duplicates of a very average card).","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"The 25 Rares were nice...but one was a foreign card.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"Which is pretty insulting, honestly.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"I feel like if a person is pulling 25 rares to set aside for the lot they should notice that one of them is in Japanese or something.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"I could see if the 25 rares were scattered throughout the lot, but they were in a chunk together at the back, meaning they were pulled at the same time.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"It's a useless card to me and feels like a rip off.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"I'm not even sure what card it IS because I've never seen the artwork before.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"Some green card with a giant spider on it.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"The variety of sets was nice...but the amount of duplicates was incredible.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"There were at least 10 cards that I got 20+ duplicates of.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"And almost none of them were cards that were any good, meaning they are the last cards I would want 20 copies of.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"I'd be fine with 20 llanowar elves, but these cards were mostly junk.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"Just an unacceptable level of duplication.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"For comparison, the most duplicates I received from Untapped Games were 6.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}
{"id":6747,"title":"","text":"Far more reasonable.","asin":"B007G91FZ2"}

{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"It appears that the designers of the software got stuck in the &#34;power up and attain magical abilities&#34; video game paradigm.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"In theory this sounds great.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"Here's the theory: as you play and win, you get points.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"You can trade the points in for upgrades to your cars.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"These upgrades include powerful armor (that makes you harder to kill), stronger weapons to counter armor, and the ability to do U turns and sudden stops.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"I've got to admit the U turns and stops are cool.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"Apparently the game theory is that serious gamers will buy the cars, upgrade as much as possible, and then compete with each other.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"But as I explain below, this theory makes the game NOT FUN for families or other casual players.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"At $200, plus $70 per extra cars, this is a lot of money for something that's frustrating.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"So what's the problem?","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"The software designers forgot this isn't a video game where you're playing against a computer AI.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"(You CAN play against AI controlled cars, but that's not a lot of fun compared to playing real people.)  ","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"The problem is that you can't remove &#34;fixed&#34; special weapons from the cars, and you can't remove armor.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"For example, to start, we had three cars, two whose special &#34;fixed&#34; weapons are tractor beams, and the third whose special weapon is a shield.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"The tractor beam slows down the car in front so you have a better chance of shooting it.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"The shield lets you take a lot of hits without being disabled.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"It quickly became clear that whoever had the shielded car had a huge advantage over the 2 cars with tractor beams.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"You could basically shoot the shielded car forever without disabling it.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"As you can imagine, this caused some bad feelings!","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"We tried to compensate for this by saying that the weakest player always got the shielded car.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"But this was a lame solution.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"The obvious problem to the upgrade model is that 1) someone gets more points, 2) they upgrade, 3) this gives them a big advantage so they get still more points, and 4) they win more games get more points, upgrade more, etc.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"So they basically run away from the competition and become unbeatable.  ","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"For example, our sneaky daughter, after racking up thousands of points, upgraded her armor a lot, making her car almost unkillable at the weapon levels of the other cars.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"The weaker cars had to use  the dubious strategy of running around the track as fast as possible like small terrified rodents.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"So essentially The designers created a game that isn't really a family game, or even a game for friends, because you can't level the playing field.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"They need to develop software that allows the players to reset the cars to defaults, where everyone is even.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"Or better yet, allow adding and removing weapons and armor without the stupid point system.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"This way it would be easy to level the playing field, or assign handicaps to better players by giving more abilities or weapons to poorer players (like poor old dad, who, after all, foots the bill).","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"It would be fun to play a game in which one person said, &#34;I want to play this game with no shields, a powerful weapons, and the ability to stop dead.&#34; And another player says, I'm going for powerful shields and the ability to U turn.&#34; It's sad that such a potentially awesome game is crippled by the myopia of the developers.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"They did just release a software upgrade that does allow removing some upgrades.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}

{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"The packaging is excellent.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"The cars come wrapped up in their nicely-weighted plastic charging cases, and the whole package looks like some real attention was paid to it.2.)","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"The race-track, too, is pretty easy to unroll, and easy to put back together.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"Just remember, the track rolls around the outside of the included storage tube.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"This is clearly to prevent unnecessary crushing of the track if you were to squish it while trying to put it inside a tube.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}

{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"The tutorial to get you started is nothing short of fantastic, and really jives with the futuristic nature of the whole package.5.)","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}

{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"The biggest issue is there just isn't very *much* to the whole set.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"You put the cars on the track and they drive themselves (you adjust the speed and position on the track, but that's it).","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"While it makes sense given the track design and zippy nature of the tiny cars, you just always get a sense of being a spectator rather than being truly involved.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}

{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"The combat, while fun at first, is not as thoughtfully integrated as I thought it would be.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"For example, why am I able to shoot at cars that are already round a corner?","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"Why, if there are two cars in front of me - when I shoot - am I hitting both cars the same amount at the same time?3.)","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"For some reason, after the first person\/car crosses the finish line, the other cars on the track just veer off the track (as a sign of defeat?).","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"This is troublesome because the cars often end up completely off the track on the floor\/carpet.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"Because the cars have extremely sticky tires, they pick up dust\/dirt\/hairs like CRAZY, so it's especially annoying to have the cars purposefully drive off onto the carpet.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"Yuck!Included in the box is a special Car Lint Roller (my name for it!).","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}

{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"After about 20 minutes of playing (about the time to drain the cars' battery), both the iPhones were quite hot, and the battery drain was quite noticeable.---It's hard to really recommend Anki Drive in its current state.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"It's definitely a fun try-it-once type of deal, but with the cost of the starter kit and extra cars, it's definitely a hard sell.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}

{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"Looking over past reviews I agree with most everything people have said.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"The difference in ratings depends on how much you have played the game and how much you are willing to spend.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"First off, it does take a large amount of space--something you should already expect but it is worth mentioning.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"Secondly, you can play with the 2 included cars without spending more money.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"But you are missing the MOST of the fun.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"The game play with only two cars is decent but due to the &#34;perks&#34; cars have, it is much more exciting with more players.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"Third, speaking of spending money....this game requires 2 high end phones, a $200 starter kit and (for more fun) more cell phones and more $70 cars.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"That gets pretty pricey for the one game.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"Fourth, the software does need to be updated to randomly assign perks\/features because once you get a really useful feature you just cream everyone else every time--which isn't fun for you or for them.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"They need to allow more options in changing the game play.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}

{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"Bottom-line -- it works really well - it provides a lot of fun and joy!Highly recommended - someone really cared in the manufacture and usability of this product.he Anki Drive Starter Kit for IOS is a fantastic product that takes the concept of the slot car track and brings it into the 21st century with some impressive technology.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"The app is extremely polished, you can race with friends or use the computer as an opponent, the cars go around the track and you control the speed, lane position and the weapon systems.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}

{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"I had suspicions about the price before I got this but considering how many options there are, how well everything is designed and how amazingly it is all executed I can say its well worth it.","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}
{"id":1973,"title":"","text":"We have run it from both old and new Iphones and Ipads and it seems to perform fine on everything, and getting 3 or 4 cars so that a bunch of kids can race really makes it exciting!!WOW!","asin":"B00G6MWM1Q"}

{"id":12905,"title":"","text":"Not only do these features make the game more interesting, but the player experiences them with over a hundred new Pokemon to trade, catch, and train.","asin":"B002CJ8Z04"}

{"id":12905,"title":"","text":"You can't play more than 15 minutes without it freezing up on you.","asin":"B002CJ8Z04"}
{"id":12905,"title":"","text":"These sellers need to provide verification that these games are real.","asin":"B002CJ8Z04"}
{"id":12905,"title":"","text":"The game had loading issues as to where I almost had to start a new game, the hall of fame data is corrupted and did not recognize some of game options I tried to use, the migrate system is corrupted as to where I can't transfer data to next gen game, but the main game worked fine with a few issues.","asin":"B002CJ8Z04"}

{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Looking forward to playing this for a long while","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"I wasted my money on the wrong one, i thought i bought the one for PS4 but this one is for PC.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}

{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Who plays games on a computer anyways?","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Buying the game inst sufficient to play the game ..","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"you also have to give your credit card and 15 more dollars even though you are supposed to get 30 days with the purchase of the game ...","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"funny how that works.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"If this had been a single-player game, I'd have given it a 4\/5 or so.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"But it really is not a good MMO, and that's what's being sold here, an MMO.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"For a play through, no matter the faction, the story is engaging, the questing is fun, and the leveling is a fun trip through an enjoyable skill system.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"The PvP is good for a while but the vast empty countrysides and throngs of enemies that can only be fought with throngs of allies, quickly diminish or outright remove any sense of individual worth if you're not a part of said throngs.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"But its all let down, ultimately, by weak and unreliable combat that is plagued with issues, bugged quests at pivotal points (was stuck on a the 50 to Veteran content quest intersection for four days... that just shouldn't be a thing), and a general lack of anything to do but wait for the next attraction as the developers expand the themepark.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"They took a sandbox single-player game and turned it into a themepark MMO on rails.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Going through the themepark once or so is a good experience but the game has no longevity aside from grind, grind, and more grind.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"There's also a question of how tolerant you are of: Kill 10 X, quests.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"They all come stories but, at the end of the day, every quest is the same: Kill X of Y, talk to Y of Z, or interact with Z of A, and even the stories eventually just become blurred and interchangeable, provided by the same five voice actors.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"I've played Elder Scrolls Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim and I love all of them.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"I've also played WOW, LOTR, and several other MMPORGs so I have a lot to compare this to.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Let's look at some of the good and bad features of this game.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Played on a Dell XPS with Intell Core i7-2760QM Quad core @2.40GHz.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Windows 7 64 bit with 16Gb RAM, NVidia 550M laptop.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"The good...Nice graphicsFamiliar races, beasts, craftingThe bad...Poor performance - very laggy in placesLong transition timesOver simplified UI - only one spot on the 'quick bar'Unstable - crashes once every 2 hours or soVery difficult to solo even the 'solo' quests.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Difficult to find right NPCs and vendors.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"I regret spending money on this and will be cancelling my subscription.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Would not recommend.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"I beta'd for this game for a long time and saw a TON I hated about the game.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"They fixed a lot of stuff by the last beta releases but the lag is still a major issue.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Couple that with subscription (really?)","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"it is not even close to worth $60.Save your money.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"This needs to go F2P and then...and only then would it possibly be worth $50.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"You get a free month of game play if you buy directly from the website.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Buy from the website I tell you!","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"The game is good and I've enjoyed playing it for a while.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"It has the right features for a game that I like to play -- an MMO that feels like a Single Player RPG -- it a perfect game for me.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"However, it might have the features that matched my gaming style but it's lacking a lot of the major feature that every MMO must have -- it doesn't have an auction house.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"In place, the game has a Guild Store that are very limited and prices can be overpriced since it's not reaching a lot of players.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Other minor annoyances are bugs on skills, terrain, and quests that makes the experience rather frustrating at times.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"I really hate dying from a fight were the reason for dying is because my skill bugged or an invisible wall prevented my skill from hitting.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"The bugged quests I can ignore, but the combat bugs is unacceptable to me.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"At low level areas, it's insignificant, but in the high level areas this bug is really frustrating to a point that I canceled my recurring subscription.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"I refuse to pay for something that frustrates me so I'm letting this one expire at the end of the month.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Although it is still worth the box price (non-Imperial) for a month of entertainment, but nothing more.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"I was hoping for a new mmo, something to give me a new world to be engaged in.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Well this is not it.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"The combat is awful for want of a better word, it is similar to neverwinters reticule combat, but where neverwinters feels fluid and fun, eso is anything but smooth or fun it is clunky and messy.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"The spell selection method seems strong.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"But it really was more confusing  than other games that use a limited action setBut the most disappointing part in the game is that it is boring.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Nothing feels epic or existing, everything has been done before and eso does not implement anything it does very well.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Unless you are a hard core fan of the law and even then give this game a miss.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Or st least wait till they have had a chance to fix the game.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"I personally believe this MMO is mainly aimed for console not PC.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Repetitive dungeon layout, voice over, stiff combat actions, the just OK graphics, less skills for you to chose, with qucick action bars that reminds you it's clearly designed for a controller not a key board.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"I will compare this game to WOW --- ESO is OK, it just not offering that much fun contents as WOW does.  ","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
{"id":10301,"title":"","text":"Lastly, I think a 10$ per month subscription fee is more suitble for it's quality.","asin":"B00I4BGNVM"}
